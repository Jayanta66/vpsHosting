To run multiple React projects on a single VPS, you should use a web server like Nginx as a reverse proxy and configure each project to run on a different port or be accessible via a different domain/subdomain. 
Prerequisites
A running VPS (typically Ubuntu).
SSH access to your VPS.
Node.js, npm, Git, and Nginx installed on your server.
Your React projects pushed to a repository (e.g., GitHub). 
Steps to Deploy Multiple React Projects
1. Set Up and Secure Your VPS 
Connect via SSH: ssh your_username@your_server_ip.
Update server packages: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y.
Set up a firewall and allow essential traffic:
bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
 
2. Clone and Build Your Projects
Clone your projects to the VPS (e.g., in the /var/www/ directory) and build their static files: 
bash
cd /var/www
sudo git clone github.com
sudo git clone github.com

cd project1
npm install
npm run build # this generates a 'build' or 'dist' folder

cd ../project2
npm install
npm run build
 
3. Configure Nginx for Each Project
Nginx will serve the static files from the build (or dist) folder of each project. You can access them via different domain names (e.g., project1.com, project2.com) or subdomains (e.g., p1.yourdomain.com, p2.yourdomain.com). 
For different domain names:
Create Nginx configuration files in /etc/nginx/sites-available/:
bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/project1.conf
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/project2.conf
Add the following configuration to project1.conf (adjust paths as needed):
nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name project1.com www.project1.com;
    root /var/www/project1/build; # or /var/www/project1/dist
    index index.html;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
Add a similar configuration to project2.conf, using project2.com as the server_name. 
4. Enable Sites and Restart Nginx 
Enable the configurations by creating symbolic links to the sites-enabled directory and restart Nginx: 
bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/project1.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/project2.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# Optionally remove the default config:
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

sudo nginx -t # Test Nginx configuration for errors
sudo systemctl restart nginx
 
5. Update DNS Records
Finally, ensure your domain names' DNS records point to your VPS's IP address. This step must be done with your domain name registrar or DNS provider. 
Alternative: Docker 
For a more scalable and isolated approach, you can use Docker and Docker Compose to containerize each React application. This ensures that dependencies for each project don't conflict and simplifies management. You would use a reverse proxy like Nginx Proxy Manager or Traefik within Docker to route traffic to the correct container.
